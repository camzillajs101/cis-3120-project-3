### Setup & Use

To launch the Gradio project, please run the `virtual_book_club.py` file:
```
$ python virtual_book_club.py
```
Or visit the [public link](https://1dcda3a26e09d02844.gradio.live/).

Once in the Gradio interface, select a genre from the dropdown and hit "Submit" to get a random book from that genre, a summary, and a list of potential discussion questions.

The Python program will first pick a book at random through a genre listing, and then use the book's title, author, and list of related topics to generate the summary and questions using Ollama's tinyllama LLM.
